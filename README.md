此仓库用于存储个人学习许宏旭所著《CMake构建实战项目开发卷》时的代码。

This repository is used to store the code for studying the book "CMake Construction Practical Project Development" written by Xu Hongxu.

Compared with the code in the original book, I have made some corrections to the code I published and added some personal experience in learning. This repository is not only a learning tutorial, but also a reference for query commands.
